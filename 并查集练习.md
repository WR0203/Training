#### 1.Wireless Network  		POJ - 2236

An earthquake takes place in Southeast Asia. The ACM (Asia Cooperated Medical team) have set up a wireless network with the lap computers, but an unexpected aftershock attacked, all computers in the network were all broken. The computers are repaired one by one, and the network gradually began to work again. Because of the hardware restricts, each computer can only directly communicate with the computers that are not farther than d meters from it. But every computer can be regarded as the intermediary of the communication between two other computers, that is to say computer A and computer B can communicate if computer A and computer B can communicate directly or there is a computer C that can communicate with both A and B. 
In the process of repairing the network, workers can take two kinds of operations at every moment, repairing a computer, or testing if two computers can communicate. Your job is to answer all the testing operations. 

**Input**

> The first line contains two integers N and d (1 <= N <= 1001, 0 <= d <= 20000). Here N is the number of computers, which are numbered from 1 to N, and D is the maximum distance two computers can communicate directly. In the next N lines, each contains two integers xi, yi (0 <= xi, yi <= 10000), which is the coordinate of N computers. From the (N+1)-th line to the end of input, there are operations, which are carried out one by one. Each line contains an operation in one of following two formats: 
>
> 1. "O p" (1 <= p <= N), which means repairing computer p. 
> 2. "S p q" (1 <= p, q <= N), which means testing whether computer p and q can communicate. 
>
> The input will not exceed 300000 lines. 

**Output**

> For each Testing operation, print "SUCCESS" if the two computers can communicate, or "FAIL" if not.

**Sample Input**

```
4 1
0 1
0 2
0 3
0 4
O 1
O 2
O 4
S 1 4
O 3
S 1 4
```

**Sample Output**

```
FAIL
SUCCESS
```

先给一个 n 和 d, n 代表电脑台数， n 代表两台电脑之间的最小通信距离。下面 n 行为 n 台电脑的坐标。然后输入任意行命令，最初所有电脑都是坏的，但输入 o i 即修复第 i 台电脑。S x y 即判断 第 x 台电脑和第 y 台电脑能否通信（x, y 均已修好且距离 <= d）。

判断两点之间的距离可以用：

```
((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)) <= d * d //这样可以避免出现负数。当然注意 d 过大出现数值越界。
```

```c++
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <string>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 1004;
int X[maxn], Y[maxn], fa[maxn];
bool P[maxn];
vector<int> v[maxn];

//寻找祖先
int Find_parent(int x) {
	if (fa[x] == x)
		return x;
	return fa[x] = Find_parent(fa[x]);
}

//初始化
void Init(int n) {
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++)
		fa[i] = i;
}

void merge(int a) {
	for (int i = 0; i < v[a].size(); i++) {
		if (P[v[a][i]]) { 			 //v[a][i] 即电脑 a 和 v[a][i] 之间是能够通信的。
			int b = Find_parent(v[a][i]);	 //如果与电脑 a 能够通信的电脑 v[a][i] 也是好的电脑,
			fa[b] = a;			 //那个就令 v[a][i] 的祖先的变为 a。
		}
	}
}

int main()
{
	int n, d;
	char s;
	cin >> n >> d;
	Init(n);
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {	
		cin >> X[i] >> Y[i];
	}
	/* 
	 * 假设所有计算机都是好的且都是能都连接到，看两者是否可以进行通信。
	 * 进行预处理，即：相当于打表。
	 * v[i][0..n] 存储了第 i 台电脑所有能通信的电脑的序号，如 v[1][0] = 2 
	 * 即：第 1台电脑可以和第 2台电脑进行通信。
	 * 两点之间直线最短，所以不存在两台电脑本身因距离过远而不可以通信，但是经过第三台电脑可以通信。
	 * 存在两台电脑距离上可以通信，但二者直接没有直接的连接，但是可以通过其他电脑的转接，从而实现通信。
	 */
	for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
		for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
			if (((X[i] - X[j])*(X[i] - X[j]) + 
				(Y[i] - Y[j])*(Y[i] - Y[j])) <= d*d) {
				v[j].push_back(i);
				v[i].push_back(j);
			}
		}
	}

	while (cin >> s) {
		int a, b;
		if (s == 'O') {
			cin >> a;
			P[a] = 1;
			merge(a);
		}
		else {
			cin >> a >> b;
			int ta = Find_parent(a);
			int tb = Find_parent(b);
			if (ta == tb)
				cout << "SUCCESS" << endl;

				cout << "FAIL" << endl;

#### 2.The Suspects			POJ - 1611

 Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), an atypical pneumonia of unknown aetiology, was recognized as a global threat in mid-March 2003. To minimize transmission to others, the best strategy is to separate the suspects from others. 
In the Not-Spreading-Your-Sickness University (NSYSU), there are many student groups. Students in the same group intercommunicate with each other frequently, and a student may join several groups. To prevent the possible transmissions of SARS, the NSYSU collects the member lists of all student groups, and makes the following rule in their standard operation procedure (SOP). 
Once a member in a group is a suspect, all members in the group are suspects. 
However, they find that it is not easy to identify all the suspects when a student is recognized as a suspect. Your job is to write a program which finds all the suspects.

**Input**

> The input file contains several cases. Each test case begins with two integers n and m in a line, where n is the number of students, and m is the number of groups. You may assume that 0 < n <= 30000 and 0 <= m <= 500. Every student is numbered by a unique integer between 0 and n−1, and initially student 0 is recognized as a suspect in all the cases. This line is followed by m member lists of the groups, one line per group. Each line begins with an integer k by itself representing the number of members in the group. Following the number of members, there are k integers representing the students in this group. All the integers in a line are separated by at least one space. 
> A case with n = 0 and m = 0 indicates the end of the input, and need not be processed.

**Output**

> For each case, output the number of suspects in one line.

**Sample Input**

```
100 4
2 1 2
5 10 13 11 12 14
2 0 1
2 99 2
200 2
1 5
5 1 2 3 4 5
1 0
0 0
```

**Sample Output**

```
4
1
1
```

找和 0 连通的值的数量，包括 0 本身。

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 30004;
int an[maxn];

int Get_parent(int x) {
	if (an[x] == x)
		return x;
	else
		return an[x] = Get_parent(an[x]);
}

void Merge(int x, int y) {
	int ta = Get_parent(an[x]);
	int tb = Get_parent(an[y]);
	if (ta != tb) {
		an[tb] = ta;
	}
}

int main()
{
	int n, m;
	while (cin >> n >> m && n + m) {
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
			an[i] = i;
		for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
			int num, x, y;
			cin >> num;
			cin >> x;
			for (int j = 0; j < num - 1; j++) {
				cin >> y;
				Merge(x, y);
			}
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
			if (Get_parent(0) == Get_parent(i)) sum++;
		}
		cout << sum << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}

#### 3.How Many Tables 		HDU - 1213

Today is Ignatius' birthday. He invites a lot of friends. Now it's dinner time. Ignatius wants to know how many tables he needs at least. You have to notice that not all the friends know each other, and all the friends do not want to stay with strangers. 
One important rule for this problem is that if I tell you A knows B, and B knows C, that means A, B, C know each other, so they can stay in one table. 
For example: If I tell you A knows B, B knows C, and D knows E, so A, B, C can stay in one table, and D, E have to stay in the other one. So Ignatius needs 2 tables at least. 

**Input**

> The input starts with an integer T(1<=T<=25) which indicate the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. Each test case starts with two integers N and M(1<=N,M<=1000). N indicates the number of friends, the friends are marked from 1 to N. Then M lines follow. Each line consists of two integers A and B(A!=B), that means friend A and friend B know each other. There will be a blank line between two cases. 

**Output**

> For each test case, just output how many tables Ignatius needs at least. Do NOT print any blanks. 

**Sample Input**

```
2
5 3
1 2
2 3
4 5

5 1
2 5
```

**Sample Output**

```
2
4
```

求多个子集合并后共有多少个集合。

```
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

const int maxn = 1000 + 4;
int an[maxn];

int Get_parent(int x) {
	if (an[x] == x)
		return x;
	else
		return an[x] = Get_parent(an[x]);
}

void Merge(int x, int y) {
	int tx = Get_parent(an[x]);
	int ty = Get_parent(an[y]);
	if (tx != ty)
		an[ty] = tx;
}

int main() {

	int T;
	cin >> T;
	while (T--) {
		int N, M;
		cin >> N >> M;
		for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++)
			an[i] = i;
		int a, b;
		for (int i = 1; i <= M; i++) {
			cin >> a >> b;
			Merge(a, b);
		}
		int sum = 0;
		for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
			if (an[i] == i)
				sum++;
		}
		cout << sum << endl;
	}
	return 0;
}
```
